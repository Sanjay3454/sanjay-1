        <p>
          On the lush alien world of Pandora live the Na'vi, beings who appear
          primitive but are highly evolved. Because the planet's environment is
          poisonous, human/Na'vi hybrids, called Avatars, must link to human
          minds to allow for free movement on Pandora. Jake Sully (Sam
          Worthington), a paralyzed former Marine, becomes mobile again through
          one such Avatar and falls in love with a Na'vi woman (Zoe Saldana). As
          a bond with her grows, he is drawn into a battle for the survival of
          her world.

          Widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time, this mob
          drama, based on Mario Puzo's novel of the same name, focuses on the
          powerful Italian-American crime family of Don Vito Corleone (Marlon
          Brando). When the don's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino), reluctantly
          joins the Mafia, he becomes involved in the inevitable cycle of
          violence and betrayal. Although Michael tries to maintain a normal
          relationship with his wife, Kay (Diane Keaton), he is drawn deeper
          into the family business.
